"""DOMShell MCP client wrapper — communicates with DOMShell MCP server via stdio.

DOMShell is a browser automation tool that maps Chrome's Accessibility Tree
to a virtual filesystem. This module provides a Python interface to DOMShell's
MCP server.

Installation:
1. Install DOMShell Chrome extension from Chrome Web Store
2. Ensure npx is available: npm install -g npx

DOMShell GitHub: https://github.com/apireno/DOMShell
Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/domshell-%E2%80%94-browser-filesy/okcliheamhmijccjknkkplploacoidnp

DOMShell 2.0.0 (May 2026) changed the default MCP tool surface from 38
per-command tools to a single `domshell_execute` tool that accepts a
shell-style command string (multi-line supported). This wrapper targets
that single tool.

    first call carries into the second.

    Why split: DOMShell's multi-line splitter continues past per-line
    errors (apireno/DOMShell#46). That's the right semantic for cleanup
    chains like ``cd / grep / cd back`` (the restore must always run)
    but the WRONG semantic for safety chains like ``focus / type`` — a
    failed ``focus`` followed by a successful ``type`` would dispatch
    keys into whatever was previously focused (potentially a password
    field). Halting between focus and type prevents that.

    Performance note: in non-daemon mode with an absolute path this
    issues up to four ``_call_execute`` calls (anchor ``cd``, focus,
    type, restore ``cd``), and each opens a fresh stdio MCP session —
    so up to four ``npx`` server spawns per call. Relative paths use
    two calls; daemon mode reuses one persistent connection for the
    whole chain regardless of path form. The per-call overhead is

    refactor could share a single ``ClientSession`` across the chain
