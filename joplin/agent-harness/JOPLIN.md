# JOPLIN Harness SOP

## Overview

`cli-anything-joplin` is a stateful CLI harness for Joplin automation backed by
the real `joplin` terminal binary. It is intended for command-driven
workflows, real-backend validation, and agent-style demo runs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Joplin terminal CLI installed and available in `PATH` as `joplin`
- The harness package installed in editable mode for local development

Verify the backend with:

```bash
where joplin       # or `which joplin` on POSIX
joplin help
```

## Install

```bash
cd joplin/agent-harness
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```bash
# REPL mode (default)
cli-anything-joplin

# One-shot command mode with JSON output
cli-anything-joplin --json notebooks list

# Use a project file
cli-anything-joplin --project ./demo.joplin-harness.json notes create "hello"

# Dry-run (no auto-save)
cli-anything-joplin --json --dry-run --project ./demo.joplin-harness.json notes create temp
```

## Command groups

- `project`: `new`, `open`, `save`, `info`, `json`, `status`
- `notebooks`: `list`, `create`, `use`, `remove`
- `notes`: `list`, `create`, `set`, `get`, `remove`, `copy`, `move`, `rename`
- `todos`: `list`, `create`, `toggle`, `clear`, `done`, `undone`
- `tags`: `list`, `add`, `remove`, `notetags`, `tagnotes`
- `search`: `run`
- `sync`: `run` (`--target`, `--upgrade`, `--use-lock`)
- `interop`: `import`, `export`
- `config`: `get`, `set`, `list`, `export`, `import-file`
- `attach`: `add`
- `status`: `show`, `restore`
- `backend`: `version`, `dump`, `keymap`, `geoloc`, `export-sync-status`
- `server`: `status`, `start`, `stop`
- `e2ee`: `status`, `target-status`, `decrypt`, `decrypt-file`
- `session`: `status`, `undo`, `redo`, `history`

## State model

The harness project is JSON-based and stores:

- `name`
- `created_at`, `updated_at`
- backend settings such as `binary` and `profile`
- user context such as `current_notebook`
- `history` as an operations log

The session keeps in-memory project state plus undo/redo snapshots.

## Save behavior

- One-shot mutating commands auto-save when a project is loaded.
- `--dry-run` disables auto-save.
- REPL mode does not auto-save; the user saves explicitly with `project save`.
- Commands that should not produce an undo snapshot (e.g. `sync run`,
  `interop export`) still mark the project dirty via `Session.mark_dirty()`
  so the auto-save still persists their history entry.

## JSON output contract

When `--json` is enabled, commands return a stable envelope:

- `ok`: boolean
- `command`: command identifier such as `notes.list`, `todos.toggle`
- `data`: command payload
- `error`: `null` on success, or `{ type, message }` on failure

## Testing strategy

### 1. Unit / command tests (`test_core.py`)
Validate harness internals and CLI contract without any backend.

### 2. CLI subprocess tests (`TestCLISubprocess`)
Run the installed `cli-anything-joplin` (or `python -m`) entry point and
assert the externally visible JSON contract for non-mutating commands.

### 3. Real-backend command tests (`TestBackendCommands`)
Single-command checks against the real backend on a fresh profile.

### 4. Real-backend workflow tests (`TestBackendWorkflows`)
Short user-flow scripts covering note lifecycle, organization, todos,
tagging, search (best-effort), sync, export, import, attach, history.

### 5. End-to-end integration test (`TestBackendIntegration`)
Full demo flow used for regression and agent demonstrations; verifies that
the saved project history captures every action performed.

### Test commands

```bash
python -m pytest -q cli_anything/joplin/tests/test_core.py
python -m pytest -q cli_anything/joplin/tests/test_full_e2e.py::TestCLISubprocess
python -m pytest -v cli_anything/joplin/tests/test_full_e2e.py::TestBackendCommands
python -m pytest -v cli_anything/joplin/tests/test_full_e2e.py::TestBackendWorkflows
python -m pytest -v cli_anything/joplin/tests/test_full_e2e.py::TestBackendIntegration
python -m pytest -v --tb=no cli_anything/joplin/tests
```

For real backend runs, ensure `joplin` is installed and available in `PATH`.

Current validation baseline (Windows + Joplin CLI 3.6.2):

- `python -m pytest -q cli_anything/joplin/tests/test_core.py` → `79 passed, 1 skipped`
- `python -m pytest -q cli_anything/joplin/tests` → `106 passed, 2 skipped`

## Development notes

- Prefer adding new coverage as a small command test first.
- Promote longer user journeys into workflow tests.
- Keep exactly one full integration flow for demonstration and regression.
- Preserve the JSON envelope and backend command naming conventions.
- Prefer Joplin's native `--format json` for list-style commands when the
  source command supports it (`ls` does; `tag list` does not).
- New mutating commands should either call `sess.snapshot(reason)` (creates an
  undo point) or `sess.mark_dirty()` (just marks the project as modified) so
  auto-save still persists the appended history entry.

## Known limitations

- Some Joplin CLI builds reject `search` outside the REPL with
  `"only available in GUI mode"`. The harness surfaces this as a normal
  `ok=false` JSON envelope; agents should treat search as best-effort.
- Non-ASCII process arguments on Windows pass through `joplin.cmd` → `cmd.exe`,
  which truncates them to the active code page. Harness JSON state handles
  unicode correctly; only argv-forwarded titles are affected. The unicode
  workflow test is skipped on Windows.
